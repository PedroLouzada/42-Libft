## About the Project

Libft was my very first project at 42 and marked the beginning of my programming journey. This project challenged me to recreate a set of essential C library functions from scratch, helping me build a strong foundation in C programming and understand low-level memory management better.

The goal was to reimplement commonly used functions like string manipulation, memory operations, and character checks without relying on the standard library. This gave me a deep insight into how these basic operations work under the hood.

---

## What I Learned

- Mastered the basics of pointers and memory allocation.
- Learned how to manipulate strings and arrays at a low level.
- Developed good habits for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable C code.
- Understood error handling and edge cases in practical scenarios.
- Improved my debugging skills with Valgrind and GDB.
- Gained experience working with Makefiles and automated testing.
- Learned the basics of linked lists and data structures through the bonus part.

---

## Functions Implemented

- Character checks: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isprint`
- String functions: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strchr`, `ft_strrchr`, `ft_strncmp`, `ft_strnstr`, `ft_strdup`
- Memory functions: `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_calloc`
- Conversion and case: `ft_atoi`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`
- Additional utilities: `ft_substr`, `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_strmapi`, `ft_striteri`
- **Bonus (linked lists):** `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`

## Compatibility

This project was developed and tested on Linux systems and requires the standard C libraries to be properly installed to work correctly.

---

## How to Use

Clone the repo and run `make`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PedroLouzada/libft.git
cd libft
make
```
The compiled library libft.a can be linked to your C projects.
## Future Improvements

- Add more utility functions.

- Improve test coverage with more edge cases.

- Explore more advanced memory management techniques.

- Refactor some functions to optimize performance.

## Final Thoughts

Libft was not just a project; it was the start of a passion for programming and problem-solving. It laid the groundwork for all the exciting challenges that followed at 42 and beyond.

Feel free to explore, learn, and build upon this foundation. Happy coding! ðŸš€
